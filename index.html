        <h2>About Afro Hair</h2>
        <p>The idea of building an e-commerce application for selling products for natural curly hair emerged from my own experience and the challenge of finding specialized products for Afro hair in France. With Brazil being a reference for hair treatments, when I arrived in Paris, I couldn't find similar products here and consequently, I had to start buying from neighboring countries that imported Brazilian products . As I'm already familiar with the realm of hair care products, I thought it would be intriguing to create a website focusing on this aspect..</p>
